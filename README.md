This repo contains all of the relevant coursework I have completed at Toronto Metropolitan University and University of Toronto. The coursework consists of individual and group projects I completed related to:
1. Machine learning model building, evaluation and predictions
2. Data science, statistical and analytics approaches and methods
3. Big Data management tools and database interactions
   
Here is a brief description of each file.
